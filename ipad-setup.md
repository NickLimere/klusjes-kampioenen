# iPad App Setup Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing the iPad version of Klusjes Kampioenen, sharing the same Firebase backend as the web application.

## Architecture

### Shared Components
- Firebase Backend (Firestore, Authentication)
- Data Models (`db-types.ts`)
- Business Logic (`db-service.ts`)
- Context Providers (User, Chore, Reward contexts)

### Platform-Specific Components
- UI Components (React Native vs React)
- Storage (AsyncStorage vs localStorage)
- Navigation (React Navigation vs React Router)
- Platform-specific features (push notifications, etc.)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize React Native project
- [ ] Install React Native Firebase
- [ ] Configure Firebase for iOS
- [ ] Set up development environment (Xcode, etc.)

### 2. Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up navigation structure
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Configure offline support
- [ ] Set up push notifications

### 3. Feature Implementation

#### Authentication
- [ ] Login screen
- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Session persistence

#### Chores Management
- [ ] Chore list view
- [ ] Chore details
- [ ] Chore completion flow
- [ ] Admin chore management

#### Rewards System
- [ ] Rewards catalog
- [ ] Points tracking
- [ ] Reward redemption
- [ ] Admin reward management

#### History & Analytics
- [ ] Chore history
- [ ] Points history
- [ ] User statistics
- [ ] Admin analytics

### 4. UI/UX Considerations
- [ ] iPad-specific layouts
- [ ] Touch interactions
- [ ] Split view support
- [ ] Offline indicators
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Error handling

### 5. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] UI testing
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Cross-platform testing

## Technical Considerations

### Data Synchronization
- Implement offline-first approach
- Handle conflict resolution
- Manage data consistency
- Optimize sync frequency

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading
- Optimize image loading
- Cache frequently used data
- Monitor memory usage

### Security
- Implement secure storage
- Handle sensitive data
- Follow iOS security guidelines
- Regular security audits

## Dependencies
- React Native
- React Native Firebase
- React Navigation
- AsyncStorage
- React Native Push Notifications
- React Native Gesture Handler
- React Native Reanimated

## Timeline
1. Project Setup: 1 week
2. Core Infrastructure: 2 weeks
3. Feature Implementation: 4 weeks
4. UI/UX Polish: 2 weeks
5. Testing & QA: 2 weeks

## Next Steps
1. Set up React Native project
2. Configure Firebase for iOS
3. Implement basic navigation
4. Create first feature (authentication)
5. Begin UI component development

## Notes
- Keep shared business logic in sync with web version
- Document any platform-specific implementations
- Regular testing on different iPad models
- Monitor Firebase usage and costs
- Plan for App Store submission process
